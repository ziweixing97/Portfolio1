                    <h1>The Reason Why....</h1>
                    <p>I struggle to find recipes that fit my dietary preferences, skill levels, or cooking styles. I found that existing apps often lack features that promote community interaction and personalized experiences. I want to create a community that people could upload their own recipe on it even it is normal. I want this app for normal people who cook for their families, roommates, or just themselves.</p>
                    <p>Because not everyone is a professional chef—but everyone eats. Most recipe apps are too fancy that doesn’t reflect how real people cook every day. I want it is a place where everyone can share their own creations and tips without needing perfect lighting or high skills. It’s about real food, real kitchens, and building a community around the kind of cooking that happens every day, not just for the social media.</p>

                        <blockquote>“Might be ok in a regular search but if you go to.... ease of use during a holiday, you should check to see if the recipe fit the category.”</blockquote>
